<h3>Backend Project</h3>
<h5 align="center">This is a backend project, from when i started programming</h5>

<p>First of all, the project has several tools:
The main ones are Express, Node.js, MongoDB, and Socket.io</p>

<p>Having these as main ones, I have some extra tools that help me give a more realistic touch to my project, such as:
    <ul>
            <p>Express (Session, Cookie Parser)</p>
            <p>Bootstrap, JSONwebtoken</p>
            <p>Socket.io</p>
            <p>Bcrypt</p>
            <p>Passport (and Local)</p>
    </ul>
