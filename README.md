<h3>Backend Project</h3>
<h5 align="center">This is a backend project, from when i started programming</h5>

<p>First of all, the project has several tools:
The main ones are Express, Node.js, MongoDB, and Socket.io</p>

<p>Having these as main ones, I have some extra tools that help me give a more realistic touch to my project, such as:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Express (Session, Cookie Parser)
            Bootstrap, JSONwebtoken
            Socket.io
            Bcrypt
            Passport (and Local)
        </li>
    </ul>

</p>
